# Canvas App  
_A Flutter-powered, AI-first client for Canvas LMS_

Canvas App gives you a clean, fast interface to Canvasâ€”but with an AI layer baked into everything. Whether youâ€™re reviewing lectures, studying flashcards, or checking assignments, the app helps you move faster by surfacing the right info and generating smart suggestions on the fly.

## ðŸ§  What AI handles

| Task | AI Involvement |
|------|----------------|
| **Chat with your courses** | Ask a question about a reading or assignmentâ€”AI pulls relevant context from Canvas and responds naturally |
| **Study flashcards** | Generates spaced-repetition flashcards from your content or quiz data |
| **Plan smarter** | Calendar includes AI-estimated difficulty + time commitment |

You donâ€™t need to copy-paste anything from Canvasâ€”this app pulls it all via API and lets the AI do the rest.
